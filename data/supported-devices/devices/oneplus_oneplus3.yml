notes:
  - title: Default password
    text: The default password is `1234`.
  - title: Unlocking SIM
    text: After entering a pin code to unlock your SIM card, you need to restart the Settings application to get access to the Mobile Network settings because the menu doesn't update automatically.
  - title: Empty APN dialog
    text: "If you get an empty Access Points window even after you have entered the info, ofono is not working properly. Run the command 'sudo systemctl restart ofono.service' to solve the issue."
  - title: Dual SIM
    text: Dual SIM functionality is currently not implemented in Phosh so only one SIM works at the moment.
  - title: Offline Charging
    text: When powered off, plugging in a charger will power on the device. If you experience a flashing screen, reboot to solve the issue. If the phone is powered on manually or rebooted, there won't be any screen flashing.
  - title: Camera
    text: Camera doesn't yet work in Droidian or Waydroid.
  - title: GPU
    text: Currently GPU only works partially in Droidian, but in Waydroid it works perfectly.
