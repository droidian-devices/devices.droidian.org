notes:
  - title: Default password
    text: The default password is `1234`.
  - title: APN
    text: Mobile data needs an APN to be set up from Settings -> Mobile Network -> Acess Point Names.
  - title: Broken mobile data after calls
    text: Data connection might break after recieving and making calls. Switch it off and on from Settings -> Mobile Network to fix it. Be careful to not turn off the mobile modem or a device restart might>
  - title: Out of storage
    text: "By default when flashing Droidian it allocates 8GB of memory to the system. This might not be enough and luckily you can allocate more storage with ADB by running (while in recovery): `adb shell resize2fs -f /data/rootfs.img xG` where __x__ is the amount of GB to allocate (eg: 50G for 50 GB)."
  - title: Bluetooth
    text: "Bluetooth can be used via the terminal using bluetoothctl command or using blueman: `sudo apt install blueman` but does not work via the settings app."
  - text: Hotspot
    title: Just like bluetooth, hotspot does not work from settings either and has to be used from a GUI application (such as the default advanced network app) or from terminal.
  - title: GPS
    text: GPS does not work.
  - title: Signal Strengh
    text: Signal strengh is reported at 1% but Mobile data and calls work just fine.
  - title: Headphones/Headsets
    text: When a headphone is plugged in it must be changed to be used manually in the settings.
  - title: Camera
    text: Anything related to cameras only works in Waydroid which.
